# Tools-for-Data-Science-Final-Graded-Notebook
There are 2 Jupyter notebooks in this public repository.
They support the graded lab assignment as part of Coursera's "Tools for Data Science".
One notebook, "DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb" contains only the executed portion of the lab.
The other notebook, "DataScienceEcosystem-WithInstructions.ipynb" contains both the description of the exercise and the corresponding code/markdown text executed to satisfy those instructions for future reference.
